## author: gerry Callaghan


## Week 1: The first week's assignment was merely to establish and submit your Github URL. 
### > There are no files in this repository for this week.


## Week 2: Write a program called bank.py 
### > This program should prompt the user to read in two monetary ammounts, add them, and print them out to specific criteria.


## Week 3: Write a program called accounts.py
### > This program must read in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits visible.


## Week 4: Write a program called collatz.py
### > This program asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.  
### > At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two,   
### > but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program ends when the current value is one.


## Week 5: Write a program called weekday.py
### > This program outputs whether or not today is a weekday. If today is a weekday, the program must say "Yes, unfortunately ## today is a weekday."   
### > while if today is a weekend day, the program must say "It is the weekend, yay!"


## Week 6: Write a program called sqrt.py
### > This program takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root,   
### > using a user-made function called sqrt and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).


## Week 7: Write a program called es.py
### > This program reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.   


## Week 8: Write a program called plottask.py
### > This program should display a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1,000 values   
### > having a with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2.   
### > Further, it should contain a plot of the function h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10 on the one set of axes.
